## Overview

This interactive dashboard provides indie game developers with data-driven insights to inform strategic business decisions about Steam game launches. The dashboard analyzes 65,455 games released on Steam between 2021 and 2025, focusing specifically on trends relevant to independent game development teams.

## Stakeholders

**Primary Stakeholder: Indie Game Development Teams**

Our stakeholders are small independent game development teams (typically 5-20 people) preparing to launch games on the Steam platform. These teams operate with constrained budgets and resources, making every product decision critical to their survival and growth. Unlike AAA studios, indie developers cannot afford expensive market research, prolonged development cycles, or failed launches.

**Stakeholder Needs:**

Indie development teams require data-driven insights to make strategic decisions about:
- Genre selection based on market saturation and growth trajectories
- Competitive pricing strategies that balance revenue with user acquisition
- Optimal release timing to maximize visibility and user engagement
- Feature prioritization based on correlation with player recommendations

## Dataset

**Steam Games Dataset 2021-2025**

The dataset contains comprehensive metadata for 65,455 games released on Steam between 2021 and 2025, collected using Steam's official API.

**Dataset includes:**
- Game identifiers (unique app IDs and names)
- Temporal data (release year and date)
- Classification (semicolon-separated genre and category tags)
- Pricing (current price in USD)
- Engagement metrics (user recommendation counts)
- Publishing data (developer and publisher information)

**Source:** [Kaggle - Steam Games Dataset 2021-2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jypenpen54534/steam-games-dataset-2021-2025-65k)

**Key Transformation:** Games were classified as "indie" if the string "Indie" appeared within their semicolon-separated genres field, enabling comparative analysis between indie and non-indie titles.

## Context and Purpose

The dashboard addresses four critical strategic questions that indie developers must answer before launching a game on Steam:

1. **Market Saturation:** How has the indie game market evolved from 2021 to 2025? Is the market growing or becoming oversaturated?

2. **Genre Opportunities:** Which genres are growing fastest and which show the highest engagement rates? Where are the best opportunities for indie developers?

3. **Pricing Strategy:** What is the relationship between price and player recommendations? What price range optimizes both revenue potential and user engagement?

4. **Release Timing:** When is the optimal time to release a game to maximize visibility while avoiding high-competition periods?

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) that allow stakeholders to explore these questions dynamically, filtering by year, genre, and price range to gain insights specific to their planned game concept.
